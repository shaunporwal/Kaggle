The values given are robust z-scores done after a quantile normalization. Which means that the value is based on the mean based on the order and then given the deviation from the mean. This means the numerical data doesn't have a linear progression.

MoA(drug) = f(drug,c,g) for each drug
Drug can have multiple associated MoA.

Calculate probability of MoA for each drug.
Drug can cause multiple MoA



### Significant Patterns
D2 and low response
D1 and high response

### Questions
how to correlate gene and cell to MoA...

   1. Use control groups to determine a baseline. In theory genes and cells should have no response to these drugs Can potentially characterize the gene / cell.
   1. Classify the MoA into possible buckets. Ideally based on quantitative
   1. Choose from Multi-label classification algos to solve this
